    "This avenue leads to many possible solutions, and the relighting problem itself is a field of \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Re-run experiments with different models\n",
    "Another idea is to ask the same questions of different types of vision models, such as \n",
    "transformer based models.\n",

    "#### Try out test-time adaptation solutions\n",

    "### Ideas to try\n",
    "What is the average of EM reflectance? Take the spectrum information that Baden refers to for the mouse habitat, assume illumination from sun. Then for every object in scene, assume it to be this material. Then minus the low-pass image, some how account for both the expected material for filling in lost information when the illumination is some strong blue, or something like that, where we have lost a lot of reflectance information for the absent \n",
